# OpenChamber Providers

> A focused provider manager for OpenCode, built as an OpenChamber extension.

An [OpenChamber](https://openchamber.dev) extension that manages custom OpenAI-compatible
providers for OpenCode from a panel on the right-hand rail, or as a full-screen page.

It writes the `providers` block of `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` (or `opencode.json`)
directly, so OpenCode reloads it on its own and the provider appears in
**Settings → Providers** — with its models, context length, capabilities and reasoning
levels. Everything else in the file stays as it was: comments, formatting, key order and
unrelated settings are preserved byte for byte.

## Features

- Add, edit and delete custom providers (third-party gateways, self-hosted runtimes)
- Provider ID, display name, API protocol, base URL and API key
- Models with decimal context and output limits, upstream model ID, image input and tool calling
- Reasoning levels as clickable cards, written as OpenCode's own `capabilities.reasoning`
- Reads both `opencode.json` and `opencode.jsonc`; edits write back to the file they came from
- Saving merges with the block on disk, so headers, request bodies, pricing, disabled
  models and hand-written variants survive
- Reads and rewrites the legacy V1 spelling (`npm` / `options` / `variants` record) into V2
- Panel follows the OpenChamber theme and layout: two columns on a page, drill-down on the rail
- No network calls, no background service

## Install

In OpenChamber: **Settings → Extensions → Folder, ZIP or URL**, paste:

```
https://github.com/leoporoluo/openchamber-providers.git
```

then choose **Add** and approve the filesystem permission (it may read and write
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and `opencode.jsonc`).

Install from a local clone instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leoporoluo/openchamber-providers.git
```

and paste the absolute path of the cloned folder into the same field.

## Usage

1. Open the panel on the rail, or **Extension pages → OpenChamber Providers** for full screen.
2. Choose **Add provider**.
3. Fill in the provider ID (e.g. `acme`), display name, API protocol, base URL and API key.
4. Add at least one model: ID, display name, context length, max output, reasoning levels,
   and whether it accepts images and calls tools.
   Context length and max output may be left blank: no `limit` is written and OpenCode
   applies its own defaults, rather than baking in numbers that may be wrong.
5. Choose **Save**. The block is written and the provider appears under
   **Settings → Providers**.

Editing and deleting work the same way. **Reload** re-reads both config files when
something changed outside the panel.

The API key is written to `settings.apiKey` as plain text. To keep the secret out of the
file, enter `{env:VAR_NAME}` (or `{file:path/to/secret}`) instead.

### Built-in overrides

A `providers.anthropic` entry that only sets `settings.baseURL` overrides a built-in
provider rather than defining a new one. The panel lists these as **Built-in override** and
leaves them untouched: it has no package or models to manage, and rewriting one would break
the override.

## Security and permissions

OpenChamber Providers makes no network requests, starts no background service and sends no
prompts to an agent. It only reads and updates the OpenCode config files listed in its
permission request.

Writes are surgical: only `providers.<id>` is replaced (and a legacy `provider.<id>` twin
removed), using `jsonc-parser` edits. The file is parsed before and after, so a broken file
is reported with its line and column instead of being overwritten.

## Compatibility

- OpenChamber 2.0.0 or newer
- OpenCode 2.x configuration format (`providers` / `package` / `settings` / `modelID`),
  with V1 configs migrated on save
- Web and Desktop OpenChamber clients

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # core logic tests, no host needed
npm run build       # bundle panel/main.ts -> panel/main.js (IIFE)
npm run build:dev   # same, unminified
npm run preview     # build a local preview page in scripts/preview
npm run check       # typecheck + test + build + preview
```

The preview runs the real panel against an in-memory config: serve the repository with any
static server and open `scripts/preview/index.html?theme=dark&locale=zh`. Add
`&surface=rail` to check the narrow layout. It is a development aid and is not shipped in
the extension.

OpenChamber never builds an extension on install, so commit the built `panel/main.js` with
the sources. To ship an update, bump `version` in `package.json`, rebuild, commit and push;
the Extensions page then offers **Update**.

## Layout

```
package.json           extension manifest (openchamber block) + build scripts
icon.svg               rail icon, masked in the current text color
panel/index.html       panel page
panel/styles.css       layout and chrome, using only host theme tokens
panel/main.ts          host connection, theme, locale
panel/app.ts           panel state, layout and interactions
panel/i18n.ts          English and Chinese copy
panel/core/json.ts     JSON value helpers
panel/core/config.ts   file location, read, and surgical JSONC writes
panel/core/provider.ts provider drafts <-> config blocks, V1 migration
panel/core/protocols.ts protocol <-> runtime package
panel/core/validate.ts form validation
panel/ui/               small DOM and icon helpers
tests/core.test.ts     core logic tests
scripts/preview/       development preview (not shipped)
```

The `core` layer has no DOM and no host dependency: it takes JSON text and values in,
returns text out, so it is testable in Node and the panel stays a thin shell over it.

## Upgrading from 1.x

Version 2.0.0 writes reasoning levels as `capabilities.reasoning` instead of hand-written
`variants`, which is what OpenCode 2 uses to build protocol-correct variants. On the first
save of a model, variants the old panel generated are dropped (standard level IDs whose
settings contain only the reasoning keys it wrote) and hand-written variants are kept. The
panel reads the old shape, so existing providers open with their levels and limits intact.
